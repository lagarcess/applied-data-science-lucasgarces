## 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to my personal data science repository! This project serves as a living portfolio of my skills, a lab for experimentation, and a journal of my journey through the fascinating world of data, machine learning, and AI. Here, I tackle everything from in-depth case studies to implementing core machine learning algorithms from scratch.

The main goals of this repository are to:

- **Solidify Knowledge:** The best way to learn is by doing. I build, test, and document concepts here to deepen my understanding.
- **Showcase Skills:** This is a live demonstration of my abilities in data analysis, model building, and software engineering best practices.
- **Explore & Innovate:** This is my playground for testing new ideas, exploring interesting datasets, and pushing the boundaries of what I know.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lagarcess/applied-data-science-lucargarces.git](https://github.com/lagarcess/applied-data-science-lucargarces.git)
    cd applied-data-science-lucargarces
    ```

2.  **Ensure you have Poetry installed.** If not, follow the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

3.  **Install the project dependencies:**
    This command will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary packages from the `poetry.lock` file.

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    To use the project's tools and libraries, you need to work inside the virtual environment. The most reliable way is to run commands with `poetry run`.
    ```bash
    # For example, to launch a Jupyter notebook:
    poetry run jupyter lab
    ```
